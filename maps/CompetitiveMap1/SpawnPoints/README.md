-- Template spawn points configuration for competitive maps
-- 
-- In Roblox Studio, create Parts or Models in this folder with the following attributes:
-- 
-- For Team 1 spawns:
-- - Set attribute "Team" to "Team1"
-- - Position on one side of the map
-- - Face toward map center or strategic position
-- 
-- For Team 2 spawns:
-- - Set attribute "Team" to "Team2" 
-- - Position on opposite side from Team1
-- - Mirror Team1 positions for balance
--
-- Example spawn layout for 4v4 support:
-- Team1: 4 spawn points spread along one side
-- Team2: 4 spawn points spread along opposite side
-- Distance between opposing spawns: 20+ studs minimum
--
-- The MapManager will validate:
-- - Spawn point balance between teams
-- - Minimum distances between opposing spawns  
-- - Coverage for different team sizes (1v1, 2v2, 3v3, 4v4)
