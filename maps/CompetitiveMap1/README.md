-- This folder represents a competitive map designed for 1v1, 2v2, 3v3, and 4v4 gameplay
-- 
-- Map Structure:
-- CompetitiveMap1/
-- ├── Geometry/          (Map buildings, terrain, cover objects)

-- To add your map:
-- 1. Build your map in Roblox Studio
-- 2. Organize parts into the folders above
-- 3. Add spawn points with Team attributes (Team1, Team2)
-- 4. Save and sync with Rojo
--
-- Requirements for competitive maps:
-- - Balanced layout with equal cover for both teams
-- - Clear sightlines but strategic cover placement
-- - At least 4 spawn points per team (for 4v4 support)
-- - Spawn points should be 20+ studs apart from enemy spawns
-- - Map size: 100-500 studs for optimal small team combat
-- 
-- The MapManager will automatically:
-- - Detect supported game modes based on spawn points
-- - Calculate competitive rating based on balance
-- - Generate spawn points if not provided
-- - Apply appropriate lighting for competitive play
