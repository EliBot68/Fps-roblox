## üéØ Key Matchmaking Algorithms Implemented

### **ELO Rating Formula**
```
New Rating = Old Rating + K-Factor √ó (Actual Score - Expected Score)
Expected Score = 1 / (1 + 10^((Opponent Rating - Player Rating) / 400))
```

### **Match Balance Score**
```
Balance Score = (Rating Balance √ó Rating Weight) + (Team Balance √ó Balance Weight)
Rating Balance = max(0, 1 - (sqrt(variance) / 400))
Team Balance = max(0, 1 - (team_difference / max_difference))
```

### **Queue Search Range Expansion**
```
Search Range = Initial Range + (Wait Time / 10 seconds) √ó Expansion Rate
Final Range = min(Search Range, Max Search Range)
```

The matchmaking system is now fully operational with enterprise-grade reliability, performance, and scalability! üéÆ
