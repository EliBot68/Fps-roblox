# Combat System Design Document

## Requirements
- **Server-authoritative hit detection** with client prediction
- **Advanced ballistics** with bullet drop and penetration
- **Weapon customization** with 50+ attachments
- **Mobile-friendly controls** with auto-aim assistance
- **Anti-cheat integration** with statistical validation
- **60+ FPS performance** with 100 concurrent players

## UX Requirements
- **Responsive firing** with <50ms input lag
- **Visual feedback** for hits, misses, and damage
- **Haptic feedback** for mobile devices
- **Accessibility options** for colorblind players
- **Customizable crosshairs** and UI elements

## Edge Cases
- **Network lag compensation** up to 300ms
- **Packet loss handling** with prediction rollback
- **Rapid fire exploit prevention** 
- **Hit validation** against speed hackers
- **Resource cleanup** for disconnected players

## Performance Budget
- **Memory**: <200MB for all combat systems
- **Network**: <15KB/s per player during combat
- **CPU**: <10% server CPU for 100 players
- **Client FPS**: 60+ on mid-range devices

## QA Checklist
- [ ] All weapons fire at correct rates
- [ ] Hit detection accuracy >95%
- [ ] No weapon exploits possible
- [ ] Mobile controls responsive
- [ ] Visual effects optimized
- [ ] Network usage within budget
