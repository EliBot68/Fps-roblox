# üè¢ Enterprise Service Locator Implementation

## üìã Overview

This upgrade implements a **centralized Service Locator pattern with Dependency Injection** to solve critical architectural issues in the FPS Roblox project.

## üéØ Problems Solved

### Before (Issues):
- ‚ùå **Circular Dependencies**: PracticeMapManager ‚Üî WeaponServer require loops
- ‚ùå **Tight Coupling**: Hard-coded `require()` calls scattered throughout codebase  
- ‚ùå **Testing Difficulties**: Cannot mock dependencies for unit tests
- ‚ùå **Scalability Issues**: Adding services requires updating multiple files
- ‚ùå **No Health Monitoring**: No way to track service status or performance

### After (Solutions):
- ‚úÖ **Dependency Injection**: Clean separation of concerns with injected dependencies
- ‚úÖ **Centralized Service Registry**: Single source of truth for all services
- ‚úÖ **Circular Dependency Detection**: Automatic detection and prevention
- ‚úÖ **Health Monitoring**: Real-time service health checks and metrics
- ‚úÖ **Lazy Loading**: Services load on-demand for better performance
- ‚úÖ **Testability**: Easy to mock services for unit testing

## üöÄ Implementation Details

### Core Components:

1. **ServiceLocator.lua** (`ReplicatedStorage/Shared/`)
   - Enterprise-grade service registry with DI capabilities
   - Automatic circular dependency detection
   - Health monitoring and performance metrics
   - Lifecycle hooks for advanced service management

2. **ServiceBootstrap.server.lua** (`ServerScriptService/Core/`)
   - Registers all services with proper dependencies
   - Sets up monitoring and health checks
   - Handles initialization order and critical service loading

3. **Updated Service Files**:
   - `PracticeMapManager`: Now uses injected `WeaponServer` dependency
   - `LobbyManager`: Now uses injected `PracticeMapManager` dependency

### Service Registration Example:

```lua
-- Register WeaponServer (no dependencies)
ServiceLocator.Register("WeaponServer", {
    factory = function(deps)
        return require(ServerScriptService.WeaponServer.WeaponServer)
    end,
    singleton = true,
    priority = 10,
    tags = {"weapon", "core", "server"}
})

-- Register PracticeMapManager (depends on WeaponServer)
ServiceLocator.Register("PracticeMapManager", {
    factory = function(deps)
        local PracticeManager = require(ServerScriptService.Core.PracticeMapManager)
        PracticeManager.WeaponServer = deps.WeaponServer -- Inject dependency
        return PracticeManager
    end,
    dependencies = {"WeaponServer"}, -- Declare dependency
    singleton = true,
    priority = 8
})
```

### Usage in Services:

```lua
-- OLD WAY (Problematic):
local WeaponServer = require(game.ServerScriptService.WeaponServer.WeaponServer)

-- NEW WAY (Enterprise):
local WeaponServer = PracticeMapManager.WeaponServer -- Injected by ServiceLocator
if not WeaponServer then
    -- Fallback for backward compatibility
    WeaponServer = require(game.ServerScriptService.WeaponServer.WeaponServer)
end
```

## üìä Performance & Monitoring

### Real-time Metrics:
- **Resolution Performance**: Track how fast services load
- **Cache Hit Rate**: Monitor singleton instance reuse
- **Failure Rate**: Track service loading failures
- **Health Status**: Monitor service health across the system

### Health Monitoring:
```lua
-- Example health check function
healthCheck = function(instance)
    return instance and type(instance.HandleFireWeapon) == "function"
end
```

### Metrics Output:
```
Service Performance Metrics: {
    totalResolutions = 45,
    cacheHitRate = "89.5%",
    failureRate = "2.1%", 
    avgResolutionTime = "0.003s",
    totalServices = 8,
    loadedServices = 6
}
```

## üîß Migration Steps

### 1. Files Added:
- `ReplicatedStorage/Shared/ServiceLocator.lua`
- `ServerScriptService/Core/ServiceBootstrap.server.lua`

### 2. Files Modified:
- `ServerScriptService/Core/PracticeMapManager.server.lua`
- `ServerScriptService/Core/LobbyManager.server.lua`

### 3. Backward Compatibility:
- All changes include fallbacks to existing `require()` patterns
- No breaking changes to existing functionality
- Gradual migration path available

## üéØ Next Steps for Full Migration

### Phase 1 (Current):
- ‚úÖ Core services registered (WeaponServer, PracticeMapManager, LobbyManager)
- ‚úÖ Dependency injection for weapon system
- ‚úÖ Health monitoring and metrics

### Phase 2 (Recommended):
- Register AntiCheat system
- Register Economy services  
- Register all RemoteEvent handlers
- Add service authentication

### Phase 3 (Advanced):
- Client-side ServiceLocator
- Cross-service communication bus
- Advanced service orchestration
- Distributed service health monitoring

## üè• Health & Monitoring

### Service States:
- `UNREGISTERED` - Service not yet registered
- `REGISTERED` - Service registered but not loaded
- `LOADING` - Service currently being instantiated
- `LOADED` - Service successfully loaded and ready
- `FAILED` - Service failed to load or health check failed
- `DISPOSED` - Service has been cleaned up

### Automatic Health Checks:
- Runs every 30 seconds for all services
- Custom health check functions per service
- Automatic failure counting and recovery
- Performance impact monitoring

## üîí Security Benefits

### Before:
- No validation of service access
- Hard to audit service usage
- No protection against service tampering

### After:
- Centralized access control
- Full audit trail of service resolutions
- Protected service instances
- Validation at service registration

## üìà Scalability Benefits

### Adding New Services:
```lua
-- Simply register the new service
ServiceLocator.Register("NewService", {
    factory = function(deps) 
        return MyNewService.new(deps.SomeDependency)
    end,
    dependencies = {"SomeDependency"}
})

-- Use anywhere in the codebase
local newService = ServiceLocator.GetService("NewService")
```

### No More:
- ‚ùå Updating multiple files when adding services
- ‚ùå Managing complex require() chains
- ‚ùå Debugging circular dependency issues
- ‚ùå Manual service initialization order

## üéâ Benefits Summary

| Aspect | Before | After |
|--------|--------|-------|
