# Rival Clash – README

## Overview
**Rival Clash** is a fast-paced competitive PvP arena game built in Roblox. Players join short matches (2–6 minutes) in small teams, use weapons to eliminate opponents, and earn rank points based on performance. Between matches, players can customize their loadouts and buy cosmetic upgrades. The goal is to provide quick, exciting gameplay with strong replayability.

## Core Features
- **Matchmaking System**  
  Groups players into balanced teams and starts matches automatically when enough players are in the lobby.

- **Server-Authoritative Combat**  
  All weapon firing, hit detection, and damage calculation is handled by the server to prevent cheating.

- **Weapons System**  
  Support for multiple weapons (starting with a basic rifle), each with unique stats like fire rate, damage, and accuracy.

- **Ranking & Progression**  
  Player skill rating (ELO) adjusts after each match. Higher ranks unlock cosmetic rewards and exclusive weapons.

- **Lobby Area**  
  Central hangout area where players can wait for matches, access shops, view leaderboards, and practice in training areas.

- **Cosmetics Store**  
  Players can purchase skins, trails, weapon camos, and other visual upgrades using in-game currency or Robux.

- **Kill Streaks & Rewards**  
  Multi-kill streaks provide temporary power-ups and bonus currency for skilled players.

- **Daily Challenges**  
  Complete specific objectives to earn extra currency and exclusive cosmetic items.

## Data Persistence
Player stats, rank, owned cosmetics, and daily challenge progress are saved between sessions using Roblox **DataStoreService** with backup systems to prevent data loss.

## Security & Anti-Cheat
- All critical actions (damage, currency changes, rank changes) are validated server-side.
- Client requests are treated as suggestions, never as final authority.
- Anti-cheat system monitors for:
  - Unrealistic fire rates and impossible reload times
  - Impossible player positions or teleportation
  - Suspicious headshot ratios and accuracy statistics
  - Currency manipulation attempts

## How to Run in Roblox Studio
1. Open the Rival Clash project folder in Roblox Studio
2. Ensure all scripts are placed in their specified locations
3. Configure the game settings in `ReplicatedStorage/Shared/GameConfig.lua`
4. Start Play Test in **Server + Multiple Clients** mode to simulate real gameplay
5. Test matchmaking by having multiple clients join the queue
6. Verify that combat, ranking, and data persistence work as expected

## Performance Guidelines
- Target 60 FPS on mid-range devices
- Optimize weapon models to stay under 10k triangles each
- Use LOD (Level of Detail) for distant objects
- Implement efficient hit detection using spatial partitioning
- Minimize RemoteEvent calls during combat

## Monetization Strategy
