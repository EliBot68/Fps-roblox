## Data Persistence
Player stats, rank, owned cosmetics, and daily challenge progress are saved between sessions using Roblox **DataStoreService** with backup systems (retry + exponential backoff + circuit breaker for failures) to prevent data loss. Critical writes batched and throttled.

## Security & Anti-Cheat
- All critical actions (damage, currency changes, rank changes) validated server-side.
- Clients treated as untrusted sources; deterministic server recomputation.
- Anti-cheat monitors:
  - Unrealistic fire rates / reload cycles
  - Impossible positions / teleport spikes / speed thresholds
  - Abnormal accuracy / headshot ratio outliers
  - Currency mutation outside controlled paths
  - Tampered remote payload sizes / invalid enums

## Assets Needed
- **Weapon Models**: Realistic but Roblox-appropriate weapon designs
- **Arena Maps**: Varied layouts for different gameplay styles
- **UI Assets**: Modern, clean interface elements
- **Cosmetic Items**: Weapon skins, player trails, and accessories
- **Sound Effects**: Weapon sounds, hit markers, and ambient audio
- **Particle Effects**: Muzzle flashes, bullet tracers, and explosion effects

## How to Run in Roblox Studio
1. Open the Rival Clash project folder in Roblox Studio
2. Ensure all scripts are placed in their specified locations
3. Configure the game settings in `ReplicatedStorage/Shared/GameConfig.lua`
4. Start Play Test in **Server + Multiple Clients** mode to simulate real gameplay
5. Test matchmaking by having multiple clients join the queue
6. Verify that combat, ranking, and data persistence work as expected

## Performance Guidelines
- Target 60 FPS on mid-range devices (90+ on high-end, 30+ on low-end mobile)
- Max per-frame RemoteEvents per client: < 20 during combat bursts
- Max weapon Fire Remote payload: < 120 bytes
- Raycasts per shot: 1 ( + optional verification ray )
- DataStore writes per player per session: <= 6 average

## Monetization Strategy
- **Premium Battle Pass**: Seasonal cosmetic rewards
- **Cosmetic Store**: Direct purchase of skins and accessories
- **Currency Boosters**: Temporary increased earnings
- **Early Access**: New weapons and maps for premium players

## Community Features
- In-game chat with profanity filtering
- Report system for inappropriate behavior
- Friends list and party system for team play
- Community-created cosmetics program

## Technical Requirements
- **Server Memory**: Optimized for 16-20 concurrent players per server
- **Data Storage**: Efficient use of DataStore quotas
- **Network**: Minimized latency for competitive gameplay
- **Mobile Support**: Touch controls and UI scaling
- **Resilience**: Graceful degradation when DataStore or MessagingService budget exceeded

## Architecture Overview
Layers:
1. Client Presentation (UIManager, HUD, input capture)  
2. Client Prediction (optional recoil & local fire animation)  
3. Transport (RemoteEvents segmented by domain)  
4. Server Domain Logic (Matchmaker, Combat, Rank, Economy)  
5. Persistence (DataStore wrapper + in-memory caches + flush scheduler)  
6. Observability (logging facade, metric sinks, audit records)  
7. Anti-Cheat (rate limiting, heuristics, anomaly flags)  

Patterns:
- ModuleScript singletons for stateless utility
- Event-driven architecture (BindableEvents internally, RemoteEvents externally)
- Data Oriented tables for hot loops (combat validation)
- Dependency inversion via lightweight service locator table

## Data Model & Schemas
PlayerProfile:
```
{
  UserId: number,
  Elo: number,
  TotalKills: number,
  TotalMatches: number,
  Currency: number,
  OwnedCosmetics: { [cosmeticId]: true },
  Daily: { Challenges: { [challengeId]: progress }, ResetAt: number }
}
```
MatchRecord (ephemeral):
```
{
  MatchId: string,
  StartedAt: number,
  EndedAt: number?,
  Players: { [userId]: { Kills: number, Deaths: number, Score: number } },
  Map: string,
  WinnerTeam: string?
}
```
TelemetryEvent (log line): `{ t=timestamp, type="Fire", p=userId, w=weaponId, pos=vector3Serialized }`

## Match Lifecycle & Event Flow
States: Lobby -> Countdown -> Active -> PostMatch -> Cleanup -> Lobby.
Primary events:
- Client: RequestMatch -> Server: QueueJoinAck
- Server: MatchStarted -> Clients: LoadoutLock + Teleport/Spawn
- Client: FireWeapon -> Server: ValidateFire -> (if hit) DamageApplied -> Client HUD Update
- Server: MatchEnded -> RankAdjust -> ProfileSaveDeferred -> Return to Lobby

## Security Hardening Checklist
- [ ] Validate all remote argument counts / types
- [ ] Clamp vector magnitudes (origin/direction)
- [ ] Monotonic server timestamps only (reject client time deltas)
- [ ] Fire rate token-bucket per weapon
- [ ] Index-based weapon reference (no free-form string trust)
- [ ] Economy operations behind server-only API (no direct Remote)
- [ ] Hash + sign sensitive audit batches before persistence (optional future)

## Anti-Cheat Strategy (Detailed)
Heuristics buckets:
- Temporal: fire cadence variance, reload overlap
- Spatial: delta position speed, vertical impulse anomalies
- Accuracy: moving accuracy > static threshold, head ratio outlier
Actions ladder:
1. Flag -> log
2. Soft shadow ban (segregated matchmaking) (future)
3. Session kick
4. Persistent ban (manual review)
Data collected hashed & truncated to respect privacy.

## Performance Budgets
| System | Budget | Notes |
|--------|--------|------|
| Per shot validation | < 1 ms server | Raycast + table updates |
| Match start setup | < 250 ms | Spawn & teams |
| Data save batch | < 50 ms | Async; fallback queue |
| Heartbeat anti-cheat loop | < 2 ms | Avoid heavy math |

Memory Targets (approx):
- Player profile: < 1 KB serialized
- Active match state per player: < 0.5 KB

## Testing & Quality Strategy
Test pyramid:
- Unit: Utilities, ELO formulas
- Integration: Match start -> end flow, fire/damage cycle
- Load Simulation: synthetic clients firing at configured RPS
- Security: fuzz remote argument counts/types
Automation:
- Pre-commit lint & static analysis (Luau type annotations future)
- Nightly soak test: 100 bot sessions (local harness)

## CI/CD & Release Management
Pipeline Stages:
1. Lint & Static Checks
2. Unit Test Run (future automated harness)
3. Package & Deploy to Staging Place
4. Automated Smoke (spawn, queue, fire)
5. Manual QA Gate
6. Promote to Production
Feature Flags for gradual rollout (per-user hashing modulo bucketing).

## Logging, Telemetry & Monitoring
Channels:
- Structured log (JSON-like) for combat & economy
- Metric counters: ShotsFired, ValidHits, Kills, MatchStarts, DataSaveFailures
- Gauges: ActiveMatches, QueueSize
- Histograms: FireValidationLatency, MatchDuration
Alert thresholds: DataSaveFailureRate > 5% in 5 min window -> alert.

## Branching & Versioning
- Main: stable
- Develop (optional): integration
- Feature/*: isolated work
- Release/*: staging hardening
- Hotfix/*: production patches
Versioning: `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` (gameplay-impacting schema bump increments MINOR).

## Localization & Accessibility
- All UI text routed through localization table keys
- Color contrast ratio >= 4.5:1 core HUD
- Optional reduced motion toggle (disables camera recoil intensity)
- Scalable UI anchors for mobile & console

## Future Roadmap (Extended Phases)
See Phases 7–10 plus potential Phase 11 (UGC & Marketplace Integration), Phase 12 (AI-driven coaching tips), Phase 13 (Advanced Replay & Share System).

## KPIs & Metrics
- D1 Retention (% of new players returning next day)
- Avg Match Completion Rate
- Shots Fired -> Valid Hit Ratio
- ELO Distribution Curve (variance target stable)
- Average Queue Time (goal < 10s off-peak, < 25s peak)
