- Integration with enterprise combat system

## Migration Status

✅ **COMPLETE** - All functionality has been migrated to the new system
✅ **VALIDATED** - No references to old system found in new codebase
✅ **TESTED** - New system fully integrated with CombatService

## Removal Schedule

**Phase 1 (CURRENT):** Deprecation notice added
**Phase 2 (Next Update):** Move to `/deprecated/` folder
**Phase 3 (Future):** Complete removal after final validation
